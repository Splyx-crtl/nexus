"""World-building scenarios: named factories that build the ``World``/``Session`` a mission needs, registered in ``SCENARIOS``.
Missions reference a scenario by name instead of embedding world data inline, so the same small set of starting points can be
reused and so a scenario can be unit-tested once rather than once per mission. One scenario commonly serves several missions
of the same act (e.g. every early Act I mission starts from the same freshly-booted player machine).

This is deliberately plain Python, not a declarative format — see ``docs/3.0-PROGRESS.md`` §C2's note on that trade-off.
